# Feature Sliced Design Best Practices: A Comprehensive Guide

Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) is an architectural methodology for scaffolding front-end applications. Simply put, it's a compilation of rules and conventions on organizing code. The main purpose of this methodology is to make the project more understandable and stable in the face of ever-changing business requirements. 

## Concepts

Layers
Layers are standardized across all FSD projects. You don't have to use all of the layers, but their names are important. There are currently seven of them (from top to bottom):

App — everything that makes the app run — routing, entrypoints, global styles, providers.
Processes (deprecated) — complex inter-page scenarios.
Pages — full pages or large parts of a page in nested routing.
Widgets — large self-contained chunks of functionality or UI, usually delivering an entire use case.
Features — reused implementations of entire product features, i.e. actions that bring business value to the user.
Entities — business entities that the project works with, like user or product.
Shared — reusable functionality, especially when it's detached from the specifics of the project/business, though not necessarily.

warning
Layers App and Shared, unlike other layers, do not have slices and are divided into segments directly.

However, all other layers — Entities, Features, Widgets, and Pages, retain the structure in which you must first create slices, inside which you create the segments.

Core principle! The trick with layers is that modules on one layer can only know about and import from modules from the layers strictly below.

Slices
Next up are slices, which partition the code by business domain. You're free to choose any names for them, and create as many as you wish. Slices make your codebase easier to navigate by keeping logically related modules close together.

Slices cannot use other slices on the same layer, and that helps with high cohesion and low coupling.

Segments
Slices, as well as layers App and Shared, consist of segments, and segments group your code by its purpose. Segment names are not constrained by the standard, but there are several conventional names for the most common purposes:

ui — everything related to UI display: UI components, date formatters, styles, etc.
api — backend interactions: request functions, data types, mappers, etc.
model — the data model: schemas, interfaces, stores, and business logic.
lib — library code that other modules on this slice need.
config — configuration files and feature flags.
Usually these segments are enough for most layers, you would only create your own segments in Shared or App, but this is not a rule.
  
### Layers

Layers are the first level of organisational hierarchy in Feature-Sliced Design. Their purpose is to separate code based on how much responsibility it needs and how many other modules in the app it depends on. Every layer carries special semantic meaning to help you determine how much responsibility you should allocate to your code.

- **App:**  All kinds of app-wide matters, both in the technical sense (e.g., context providers) and in the business sense (e.g., analytics).
- **Pages:** Pages are what makes up websites and applications (also known as screens or activities). One page usually corresponds to one slice, however, if there are several very similar pages, they can be grouped into one slice, for example, registration and login forms. In a page slice you can typically find the page's UI as well as loading states and error boundaries (📁 ui) and the data fetching and mutating requests (📁 api). It's not common for a page to have a dedicated data model, and tiny bits of state can be kept in the components themselves.
- **Widgets:** The Widgets layer is intended for large self-sufficient blocks of UI. Widgets are most useful when they are reused across multiple pages, or when the page that they belong to has multiple large independent blocks, and this is one of them. If a block of UI makes up most of the interesting content on a page, and is never reused, it should not be a widget, and instead it should be placed directly inside that page.
- **Features:** This layer is for the main interactions in your app, things that your users care to do. These interactions often involve business entities, because that's what the app is about.

A crucial principle for using the Features layer effectively is: not everything needs to be a feature. A good indicator that something needs to be a feature is the fact that it is reused on several pages.

For example, if the app has several editors, and all of them have comments, then comments are a reused feature. Remember that slices are a mechanism for finding code quickly, and if there are too many features, the important ones are drowned out.

Ideally, when you arrive in a new project, you would discover its functionality by looking through the pages and features. When deciding on what should be a feature, optimize for the experience of a newcomer to the project to quickly discover large important areas of code.

A feature slice might contain the UI to perform the interaction like a form (📁 ui), the API calls needed to make the action (📁 api), validation and internal state (📁 model), feature flags (📁 config).
- **Entities:** Slices on this layer represent concepts from the real world that the project is working with. Commonly, they are the terms that the business uses to describe the product. For example, a social network might work with business entities like User, Post, and Group.

An entity slice might contain the data storage (📁 model), data validation schemas (📁 model), entity-related API request functions (📁 api), as well as the visual representation of this entity in the interface (📁 ui). The visual representation doesn't have to produce a complete UI block — it is primarily meant to reuse the same appearance across several pages in the app, and different business logic may be attached to it through props or slots.
- **Shared:** This layer forms a foundation for the rest of the app. It's a place to create connections with the external world, for example, backends, third-party libraries, the environment. It is also a place to define your own highly contained libraries.

This layer, like the App layer, does not contain slices. Slices are intended to divide the layer into business domains, but business domains do not exist in Shared. This means that all files in Shared can reference and import from each other.

### Slices

Slices are the second level in the organizational hierarchy of Feature-Sliced Design. Their main purpose is to group code by its meaning for the product, business, or just the application.

The names of slices are not standardized because they are directly determined by the business domain of your application. For example, a photo gallery might have slices photo, effects, gallery-page. A social network would require different slices, for example, post, comments, news-feed.

The layers Shared and App don't contain slices. That is because Shared should contain no business logic at all, hence has no meaning for the product, and App should contain only code that concerns the entire application, so no splitting is necessary.

Slices are meant to be independent and highly cohesive groups of code files. An ideal slice is independent from other slices on its layer (zero coupling) and contains most of the code related to its primary goal (high cohesion).

### Segments

Segments are the third and final level in the organizational hierarchy, and their purpose is to group code by its technical nature.

There a few standardized segment names:

- **ui:** Everything related to UI display: UI components, date formatters, styles, etc.
- **api:** Backend interactions: request functions, data types, mappers, etc.
- **model:** The data model: schemas, interfaces, stores, and business logic.
- **lib:** Library code that other modules on this slice need.
- **config:** Configuration files and feature flags.

### Public API

A public API is a contract between a group of modules, like a slice, and the code that uses it. It also acts as a gate, only allowing access to certain objects, and only through that public API.

In practice, it's usually implemented as an index file with re-exports (exports from LoginPage, RegisterPage slices):

pages/auth/index.js
export { LoginPage } from "./ui/LoginPage";
export { RegisterPage } from "./ui/RegisterPage";

A good public API makes using and integrating into other code a slice convenient and reliable. It can be achieved by setting these three goals:

The rest of the application must be protected from structural changes to the slice, like a refactoring
Significant changes in the behavior of the slice that break the previous expectations should cause changes in the public API
Only the necessary parts of the slice should be exposed

// ❌ BAD CODE BELOW, DON'T DO THIS
export * from "./ui/Comment";  // 👎 don't try this at home
export * from "./model/comments";  // 💩 this is bad practice
